# Engineer view

## What it is

Screen 3. With a slice open on the wave board (`#/<repoId>/<plan>/board/<code>`), the engineer view sits under the board frame: the slice's engineer, its details (branch, files owned, tests first, last active, model, tokens), and a live tool timeline of tool names and short summaries. Covers the features.md rows Engineer view and Engineer view shows no secrets. Rules in `packages/web/src/screens/engineer/view.ts`, fetching in `timeline-loader.ts`; the timeline itself is built by the model's `parseAgentTimeline` and served by `GET /api/agents/:repoId/:agentId/timeline`.

## How it works

- **The engineer** is the latest-started engineer agent whose role is this slice of the shown sprint. None → `No engineer has started on this slice yet.`
- **Details:** branch (the agent's, else the slice's), files owned from the sprint doc, `Tests first` as `yes`/`no` then `<k> test files · <r> runs · last passed|failed` (unknown parts left out), last active (`s ago`, `min ago`, `h ago`, `ended HH:MM`), model, tokens. A disabled `Step in (phase 3)` button.
- **Timeline:** one row per tool call, `HH:MM`, summary, `→ ok` or `→ failed`; the server keeps the newest 300 and the view says how many earlier steps aren't shown. 404 → `No transcript found for this engineer.`; a load error keeps the last timeline under a `stale` chip.
- **Summaries** come only from the tool name, repo-relative paths, a known program and subcommand (`Bash: pnpm test`), a host for WebFetch, or a fixed word. Never prompts, assistant text, thinking, tool output, command arguments, patterns, or edit contents.
- **Loader:** fetches only when the key `{ repoId, agentId, lastAt, ended }` changes; one request in flight; an older response is dropped.

## Why it's this way

- **Names and short summaries only**, not raw output with masking: transcripts can hold secrets, and masking is never complete. Plan Key decision; checked with a planted fake secret in every field.
- **Fixed word lists for shell commands:** only programs that take subcommands show one, so `echo test` reads `echo`, not a test run. An earlier rule counted any `test` word (`runs: 4` for one real run).
- **No polling:** a transcript write moves the agent's `lastAt` on the Board, which already arrives over SSE, so each board event that moves it gives one fetch. The server caches the file by size and mtime.
- **No Open worktree button**: it's an action, and actions start in phase 2.

## Watch out

- File paths a tool touched are shown by design, so a secret that is itself a file name shows. Nothing else from the transcript should.
- Any new word added to a summary list must be safe to show. A program not on the list never shows a subcommand and never counts as a test run; `pnpm run test:unit` and `npx -p pkg vitest` don't count.
- An error isn't retried for the same key: an ended agent with a failed load stays on the note until reload or reopening the slice.
- The timeline follows `lastAt`, which moves only on records with a timestamp.
- `AgentRun.description` must never be shown here; it's still in `/api/board` and queued to be dropped.
